the steps are simple,

1) we create packet of size eth_header + arp_header
2) fill eth_header with dest mac address and source mac address
3) fill arp header with dest mac, ip address and source mac, ip address
4) then we simply send these arp reply packets






after that we keep sending arp reply packets to the victim
